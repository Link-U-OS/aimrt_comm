# AimRTe

## Brief

- AimRTe is an engineering encapsulation and enhancement layer built on top of AimRT, targeting modern robotics and intelligent device scenarios and providing a more ready‑to‑use runtime solution.
- On top of inheriting AimRT’s lightweight, easy‑to‑deploy, and resource‑friendly characteristics, AimRTe adds capabilities such as modular organization, unified configuration and startup, and standardized communication and protocol abstractions for large‑scale engineering projects.
- AimRTe also offers enhanced encapsulation for online issue diagnosis and stability assurance, providing exception capturing, crash dumping, and diagnostic capabilities including minidump, which, combined with logging and monitoring tools, helps quickly troubleshoot and recover in complex distributed systems.
